{"question": "Sue is traveling from New York to San Francisco, 16 hours later after landing in New York from New Orleans. If the journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 times as much time as she takes to travel from New York to San Francisco, and she lands in San Francisco 24 hours later after departing from New York, calculate the total time she took to reach San Francisco from New Orleans?", "solution": "If the journey from New Orleans to New York took 3/4 times as much time as she takes to travel from New York to San Francisco, the journey from New Orleans to New York took (3/4)*(16)=12 hours. \nSince she landed in San Francisco 24 hours later after departing from New York, she took 24+16=40 hours to reach San Francisco from New Orleans. The answer is: 40 "}
